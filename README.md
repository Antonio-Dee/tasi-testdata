In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and validate data contained in these documents. 
We consider a case study focused on Test Data related to electronic boards used in Thales Alenia Space's satellites. Since Thales Alenia Space has strict rules that protect its data privacy, the Test Data, is not disclosed in its original form. 
Instead, we add noise to the numerical values in the data, ensuring the structure and syntax remain intact without disclosing any sensitive information. We make this obfuscated dataset available in this repository for enhancing the reproducibility of the work and potential reuse for future research.
